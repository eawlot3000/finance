MSTR issued and announced the [pricing of convertible notes](https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-pricing-of-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes_12-09-2020) of its company to any investor, for the first time, to use the money to purchase bitcoin.

and on nov 18, 2024, the company used a 5-year with 0% interest "[Convertible Notes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/senior-convertible-note.asp)" to legally raise more money to purchase [more](https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-proposed-private-offering-of-1-75b-of-convertible-senior-notes_11-18-2024) and [more](https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-pricing-of-convertible-senior-notes-11-20-2024) BTC regardless of the BTC prices. for the long term, for this company, there is only one ultimate goal: buying and owning as much as possible of the BTC in the whole world till owned all of the 21 million of BTC (ideally; but highly likely not possible). and keep increasing btc per share.

## key points:

* any Investment has risk and volatility, so anybody need to do "diversification" of any investing choices. but mstr do not do that, in contrast, they all in BTC. mstr believe that due to the limited issued quantity and unique existance feature of btc, it is a rarely no-risk investment among all of the choices to boost the companies and all affiliated beneficiaries.
* btc will worth more than 100x than today in 20+ years.
* in 2013 MS believe bitcoin would failed.
* Michael Saylor argued and convinced himself first just 4 years ago in 2020, about this "all in bitcoin" strategy for MSTR. and then share and convince anybody else who was in charged of the company and have anybody agreed on this strategy.
* MSTR securitize bitcoin (23:32 of video)
* MSTR leverage BTC by 1.5x. if bitcoin's average revenue is 50%, MSTR stock is 75%-80%. if btc's volatility is 50%, MSTR is 70%-90% of volatility. High volatility + high performance.
* MSTR and MS thinks that anybody who are (truthfully) willing to purchase the MSTR stock are the people who think the BTC will keep raising over years, just like MS, and they are pro-bc, and they believe BTC will 100% worth more _N_x (10x, 100x, 1000x) at a certain time in the future. and btc prices go up, and mstr prices also go up, on a ratio of 1 : ~1.5
* MS suggests any big tech or any companies in the world should do it (buy more and more BTC) since it will be the fastest way to grow your company and all affiliated beneficiaries.
* MSTR issued "convertible bonds" that keeps the same profits and make investor less risky (26:57)
* MSTR right now has high liquidity of trading their stock every day.
* MS think the trick is not to hold $50 trillion [treasury securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond) because of it has "only" 5% of volatility but to use the same amount of money to purchase bitcoin with 50% of volatility. Own the capital in "high volatility" bitcoin form in order to boost everything of the company. in summary, higher volatility (not risk), higher return.

* volatility is different from risk.

* MS thinks BTC goes up 50% every year (36:02), and will double itself by every 3-year. that becomes the fastest investment of increasement. 
* MS prediction is there will be a average of 29% rise-up rate for the future 21 years. if bearish, only 20%. (also see the btc model by MSTR on github)

* VIX <<--- DVOL 43:44
* if you have a mediocre company, invest as much as possible of bitcoin in all the ways you can, and even if your company fails, you still have 10x, 20x, 30x, 50x, 100x of profit generated by bitcoin.

MicroStrategy Announces Pricing of Offering of Convertible Senior Notes
Press Release  •  December 9, 2020

TYSONS CORNER, Va., December 9, 2020 — MicroStrategy® Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR) (“MicroStrategy”) today announced the pricing of its offering of $550 million aggregate principal amount of 0.750% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the “notes”). The notes will be sold in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). MicroStrategy also granted to the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $100 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. The offering is expected to close on December 11, 2020, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

The notes will be unsecured, senior obligations of MicroStrategy, and will bear interest at a rate of 0.750% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2021. The notes will mature on December 15, 2025, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. Subject to certain conditions, on or after December 20, 2023, MicroStrategy may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of MicroStrategy class A common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time ending on the trading day immediately before the date the notice of redemption is sent. 

Holders of notes may require MicroStrategy to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of certain events that constitute a fundamental change under the indenture governing the notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. In connection with certain corporate events or if MicroStrategy calls any note for redemption, it will, under certain circumstances, be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert their notes in connection with such corporate event or notice of redemption.

The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock, at MicroStrategy’s election. Prior to June 15, 2025, the notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. 

The conversion rate for the notes will initially be 2.5126 shares of MicroStrategy class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $397.99 per share. This represents a premium of approximately 37.5% over the last reported sale price of $289.45 per share of MicroStrategy class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on December 8, 2020. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.

MicroStrategy estimates that the net proceeds from the sale of the notes will be approximately $537.2 million (or approximately $634.9 million if the initial purchasers exercise in full their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by MicroStrategy. 

MicroStrategy intends to invest the net proceeds from the sale of the notes in bitcoin in accordance with its Treasury Reserve Policy pending the identification of working capital needs and other general corporate purposes.

The notes are being offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The offer and sale of the notes and the shares of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and the notes and any such shares may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. The offering of the notes is being made only by means of a private offering memorandum.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy the notes, nor shall there be any sale of, the notes in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

**新闻稿 • 2020年12月9日**  

弗吉尼亚州泰森斯角，2020年12月9日——MicroStrategy® Incorporated（纳斯达克代码：MSTR）（以下简称“MicroStrategy”）今天宣布其5.50亿美元总本金金额的0.750%可转换高级票据（以下简称“票据”）的发行定价，该票据将于2025年到期。票据将在根据1933年《证券法》（以下简称“证券法”）第144A条规定的基础上，通过私人发售出售给符合条件的机构买家。MicroStrategy还授予票据的初始购买者在票据首次发行之日起13天内额外购买最多1亿美元总本金金额票据的选择权。本次发行预计将于2020年12月11日完成，需满足惯常的交割条件。  

票据为MicroStrategy的无担保高级债务，每年利率为0.750%，按半年期支付利息，首次支付日期为2021年6月15日，其后每年的6月15日和12月15日支付。票据将于2025年12月15日到期除非根据票据条款提前回购、赎回或转换。从2023年12月20日开始，在满足特定条件的情况下，MicroStrategy可按票据本金金额的100%加上已计提但未支付的利息（若有）赎回全部或部分票据，但不包括赎回日期。赎回通知发送前的指定时间内，MicroStrategy的A类普通股最后报告的销售价格至少达到当时转换价格的130%。  

票据持有人在某些事件发生时，可要求MicroStrategy按照票据本金金额的100%加上截至回购日期的已计提但未支付的利息回购其票据。如果发生某些公司事件或MicroStrategy赎回任何票据，根据某些情况下，MicroStrategy需要增加票据持有人在相关公司事件或赎回通知下选择转换票据的转换率。  

票据可转换为现金、MicroStrategy的A类普通股或现金与A类普通股的组合，具体由MicroStrategy决定。在2025年6月15日之前，票据仅在特定事件发生和特定时间段内可转换，其后可随时换至到期日的前两个预定交易日。  

票据的初始转换率为每1,000美元票据本金金额可转换为2.5126股MicroStrategy A类普通股，相当于约每股397.99美元的初始转换价格。这比MicroStrategy A类普通股在2020年12月8日纳斯达克全球精选市场上的最后报告销售价格289.45美元高出约37.5%。当某些事件发生时，转换率将作相应调整。  

MicroStrategy预计此次票据发行的净收益约为5.372亿美元（若初始购买者完全行使其额外购买票据的选择权，则净收益约为6.349亿美元），扣除初始购买者的折扣、佣金及MicroStrategy预计支付的发行费用后。  

MicroStrategy计划根据其财政储备政策，将此次票据发行的净收益投资于比特币，直到确定营运资金需求和其他一般公司用途。  

此次票据是依据《证券法》第144A条向符合条件的机构买家发售和出售的。票据及因票据转换而发行的MicroStrategy A类普通股（若有尚未且不会根据《证券法》或其他司法辖区的证券法登记，且在未登记或无适用的登记豁免的情况下，不得在美国提供或出售。票据的发售仅通过私人发行备忘录进行。

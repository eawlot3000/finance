# it will have 3 parts in here.


## part i:
it involves market structure, the most important part of the strategy.

so it has:
* uptrand
* downtrend

--> a chart that makes higher highs and higher lows is an uptrend.
--> a chart that makes lower highs and lower lows is a downtrend.

in order for a low to be validated, it needs to break the previous low.

to find the next valid low, we need to find the next valid high, which the high that is higher than the previous high.
so the new valid low will be transferred to the new valid low at that point.

so in summary, the market structure is the most important part of the strategy, which need to make sure if we are in an uptrend or downtrend!


## part ii:
identifying supply and demand in the market. demand zones take place in uptrands, and supply zones take place in downtrends. a good style of thinking is you want to buy from the demand zone and sell from the supply zone.


find the CONSOLODATION ZONES first,

so IF we are in an uptrend, we look for DEMAND ZONES opportunity to buy from. first we identify a consolidation area or a point where price move sideways before having a sharp move upward. use "rectangle" tool to draw the consolidation area. then mark from the low to the high of the previous candle before the big move. and that, is the AREA of DEMAND. (and at that case, we are not looking for area of supply since we in a uptrend).

so we wait for price to re-enter into this demand zone, and that will be our entry point. then, set your "stop loss"
right below the demand zone, and set your "take profit" at the recent high.

and verse versa for the downtrend! (do it in the supply zone!)



## part iii:
risk & reward ratio. after you set a stop loss and take profit, you need to make sure that the take profit is at least 2.5 times the stop loss. meaning for every $250 you are getting back, you are only risking $100.

only make trades that meets all these 3 criteria. if it doesn't meet all 3, then don't make the trade.

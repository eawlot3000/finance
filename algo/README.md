# THE AUTOMATD STOCK TRADING PROJECT.


## Workflow Summary:
* `file0.py` pull the data of tickers from Alpha Vantage API and create ticker.csv file, must contains columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
* `file1.py` use python ibkr api, to get the real-time streaming data, during normal trading hours
* `file1.py` write these real-time data into each ticker.csv file, fill new rows constantly for each new data (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
* `file2.py` a dedicated python file to calcuate the indicators (MACD/SMA/EMA/RSI/ATR/VWAP), and write the indicators into the same ticker.csv file (created new headers)
* `file3`, `the MOST IMPORTANT ONE` pure algorithmic trading / dedicated python file to make the trading decision (need to implement the logic more!!! like stop loss, take profit, etc.) MUST DO BEFORE deploy in the real world trading: **Backtesting**:
   - Use historical data to test the algorithmâ€™s performance and refine the logic. (draw signal and graphs)

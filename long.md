# to make a LONG

* if the charts / data is shown as this, you may start:

[some factors that i use:]
- EMA 200
- MACD
- RSI


thoughts:
(for a perfect beginning LONG:)
- the current price is above (slightly above) or very close to the EMA 200.
- MACD Line & Signal Line are all below 0, and heading to the zero (a raising trend to 0).
- MACD Line crosses the Signal Line and is greater than than the Signal Line.
- RSI is below 50; preferably below 30, or the lower, the better (because the lower, the higher possibility it could be in "oversold" and could yield a shift soon).
